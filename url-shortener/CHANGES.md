# CHANGES.md

This document outlines the implementation of the URL shortener service.

## 1. Features Implemented

The following features were implemented as per the requirements:

*   **URL Shortening Endpoint (`POST /api/shorten`)**:
    *   Accepts a long URL and returns a 6-character alphanumeric short code.
    *   Validates the URL before shortening.
    *   Stores the URL mapping in a thread-safe in-memory data store.

*   **Redirect Endpoint (`GET /<short_code>`)**:
    *   Redirects to the original URL associated with the short code.
    *   Tracks the number of clicks for each short code.
    *   Returns a `404 Not Found` error if the short code does not exist.

*   **Analytics Endpoint (`GET /api/stats/<short_code>`)**:
    *   Returns the original URL, creation timestamp, and click count for a given short code.
    *   Returns a `404 Not Found` error if the short code does not exist.

## 2. Architecture and Design

*   **Code Organization**: The application is organized into separate modules for the main application, models, and utility functions, promoting a clear separation of concerns.
*   **Data Model**: An in-memory dictionary with a `threading.Lock` is used to store the URL mappings, ensuring thread safety for concurrent requests.
*   **Error Handling**: The application includes basic error handling and returns appropriate HTTP status codes for different scenarios.
*   **Testing**: A comprehensive test suite with 8 tests was developed to cover the core functionality and error cases.

## 3. Assumptions and Trade-offs

*   **In-Memory Storage**: The data is stored in memory, which means it will be lost when the application restarts. This is in line with the project requirements, which state that an external database is not necessary.
*   **No User Authentication**: The service does not have user authentication, as specified in the requirements.
*   **Simple Short Code Generation**: The short code generation is simple and does not guarantee that a short code will not be generated more than once. The code handles this by retrying until a unique short code is found. For a large-scale application, a more robust approach would be needed.

## 4. AI Usage

No AI assistants were used in the creation of this solution.
